Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning 
of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth
after the king's mowings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of 
the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob 
arise? for he is small.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: 
and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great 
deep, and did eat up a part.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob

The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus he shewed me: and, 
behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his 
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD said 
unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, 
Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not 
again pass by them any more:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of 
Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with 
the sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath 
conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not 
able to bear all his words.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall 
surely be led away captive out of their own land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, 
flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy 
there:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But prophesy 
not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's 
court.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered 
Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but 
I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and 
the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore hear thou the word of 
the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word 
against the house of Isaac.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the 
city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land
shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel 
shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public
