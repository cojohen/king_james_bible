</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they 
were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the barbarous people shewed us 
no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because 
of the present rain, and because of the cold.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid 
them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his 
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the 
barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, 
No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet
vengeance suffereth not to live.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit they looked when he 
should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a
great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said
that he was a god.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>In 
the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name
was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that the 
father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul
entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So when this was done, others also, 
which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Who also honoured us with many 
honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were 
necessary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And after 
three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the 
isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three 
days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thence 
we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind 
blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with 
them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they 
came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the 
prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by 
himself with a soldier that kept him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called 
the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto
them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or
customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the
hands of the Romans.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no 
cause of death in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>
But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; 
not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see 
you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with 
this chain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, 
neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But we desire to hear of 
thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where
it is spoken against.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>
And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; 
to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them 
concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from 
morning till evening.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>
And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they agreed not among 
themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the 
Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
