LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of
the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive
Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the 
carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</P></TD>

figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very 
naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very 
evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Chaldeans for their good.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>

this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant 
them, and not pluck them up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4>

their whole heart.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith
the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the 
residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land 
of Egypt:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will 
deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, 
to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I
shall drive them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be 
consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.</P></TD></TR>
