said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the 
heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs before him:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And that thou mayest tell in the 
ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and 
my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses and 
Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the
Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people
go, that they may serve me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring 
the locusts into thy coast:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see 
the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which 
remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for
you out of the field:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the 
houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers'
fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. 
And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long 
shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD 
their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses and Aaron were brought again 
unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are
they that shall go?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with 
our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold
a feast unto the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, 
and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Not so: go now ye that are men, and 
serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's 
presence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the 
locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of
the land, even all that the hail hath left.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of 
Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all
that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And the locust went up 
over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very 
grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither 
after them shall be such.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was 
darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the 
trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the
trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Pharaoh called for Moses 
and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and 
against you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD 
your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went out from Pharaoh, and 
entreated the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and 
cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But the LORD 
hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel 
go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD said 
unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness 
over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses stretched forth his hand 
toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three 
days:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>They saw not 
one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the
children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, 
serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little
ones also go with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that 
we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an 
hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we 
know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's 
heart, and he would not let them go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28>
<H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to 
thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt 
die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, 
Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
