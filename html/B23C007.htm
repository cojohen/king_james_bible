to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of 
Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of 
Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail 
against it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it was 
told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his 
heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are
moved with the wind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and
Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway 
of the fuller's field;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted 
for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin
with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of 
Tabeal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the 
Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, 
Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but
will ye weary my God also?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>
