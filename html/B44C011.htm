</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also
received the word of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision 
contended with him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But Peter rehearsed the matter 
from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I was in the city of Joppa praying: 
and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a
great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Upon the which when I had 
fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I heard a voice saying unto me, 
Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time 
entered into my mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call 
not thou common.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, immediately there 
were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto 
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Spirit 
bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied 
me, and we entered into the man's house:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, 
which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose 
surname is Peter;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Who 
shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And as I began to speak, the 
Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that 
he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the 
Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Forasmuch 
then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord 
Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>When they heard these things, they 
held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles 
granted repentance unto life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose 
about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching
the word to none but unto the Jews only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, 
when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD 
Jesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the hand 
of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the 
Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then tidings of 
these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they 
sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Who, when he came, and had seen the 
grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they
would cleave unto the Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and 
much people was added unto the Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25>
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he had found him, he 
brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled 
themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
called Christians first in Antioch.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27> 
<H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And there stood up one of 
them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great 
dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius 
Caesar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto 
the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30> 
<H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of 
Barnabas and Saul.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale -
