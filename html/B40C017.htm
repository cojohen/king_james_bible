after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth
them up into an high mountain apart,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>

sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

talking with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if 
thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, 
and one for Elias.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a
voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased; hear ye him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore 
afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jesus came 
and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

they saw no man, save Jesus only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, 
saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the 
dead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first 
come?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jesus 
answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But I say 
unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto 
him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they were come to the 
multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and 
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Lord, have 
mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth
into the fire, and oft into the water.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

cure him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jesus 
answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be 
with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the disciples to Jesus 
apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall
remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

strangers?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Peter

Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an
hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his
mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me
