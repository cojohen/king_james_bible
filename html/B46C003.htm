And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto 
carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2>
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were 
not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among 
you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For while one saith, I am 
of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, 
but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>I have planted, Apollos watered; 
but God gave the increase.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; 
but God that giveth the increase.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man 
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth 
thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For other foundation can no man 
lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall 
declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every 
man's work of what sort it is.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4>

receive a reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>If 
any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be 
saved; yet so as by fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God 
dwelleth in you?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>If 
any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God 
is holy, which temple ye are.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>

this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For the wisdom of this world is
