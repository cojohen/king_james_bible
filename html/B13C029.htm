<TD><P>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, 
whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for 
the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of 
my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of 
silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and 
wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones,
and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in 
abundance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover, 
because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own
proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, 
over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Even three thousand talents of gold, of 
the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the 
walls of the houses withal:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for 
all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is 
willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the chief of the fathers and 
princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And gave for the service of the house of 
God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten 
thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred 
thousand talents of iron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of 
the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the people rejoiced, for that they 
offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore David blessed the LORD 
before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of 
Israel our father, for ever and ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the 
glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in 
the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head
above all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Both 
riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is 
power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength 
unto all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But who am I, and what is my 
people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all
things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are strangers before thee, and 
sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and 
there is none abiding.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house 
for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>I know also, my God, that thou 
triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the 
uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now
have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly 
unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>O LORD God 
of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the 
imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart 
unto thee:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And give 
unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, 
and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the 
which I have made provision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. 
And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down 
their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and 
offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a 
thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink
offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And did eat and drink before the LORD 
on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king
the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and 
Zadok to be priest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, 
and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the 
sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD magnified 
Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such
royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus David the son of Jesse 
reigned over all Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years 
reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he died in a good old 
age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his 
stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the acts 
of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of
Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad 
the seer,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>With all 
his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and 
over all the kingdoms of the countries.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
