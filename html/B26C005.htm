thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and
cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to 
weigh, and divide the hair.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the 
days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite 
about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I
will draw out a sword after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>

</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the Lord GOD; 
This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that 
are round about her.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my 
statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have 
refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the Lord 
GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and
have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have
done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the 
Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the 
midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine 
abominations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons 
shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole
remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, 
because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with 
all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine 
eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all 
the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will 
cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know 
that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover I will

</P></TD><TD><P>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an 
astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute 
judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have
spoken it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>When I 
shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their 
destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the
famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>So will I send upon you famine and 
evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass
through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken
it.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale - John M. Hurt
