<TD><P>And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that 
kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the
country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David 
tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And David took the crown of their king 
from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were 
precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also 
exceeding much spoil out of the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with 
saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the 
cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to 
Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came 
to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at

like a weaver's beam.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose
fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot 
and he also was the son of the giant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
