are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, 
which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>But Jerusalem which is above is 
free, which is the mother of us all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27>

<A HREF=B23C054.htm#V1>Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break 
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more
children than she which hath an husband.</A>

he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,

Nevertheless what saith the scripture? 
<A HREF=B01C021.htm#V10>Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for 
the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</A>
<BR>Gen 21:10
