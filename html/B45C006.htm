say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead 
to sin, live any longer therein?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ 
were baptized into his death?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as 
Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also 
should walk in newness of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we 
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with 
him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not 
serve sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that 
is dead is freed from sin.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with 
him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing that 
Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion 
over him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For in that 
he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise reckon ye also 
yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ 
our Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Let not sin 
therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts 
thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither 
yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield 
yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as 
instruments of righteousness unto God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

not under the law, but under grace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but 
under grace? God forbid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his 
servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience 
unto righteousness?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from 
the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Being then made free from sin, ye 
became the servants of righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak after the manner of men because of the 
infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members 
servants to righteousness unto holiness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from 
righteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>What 
fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of 
those things is death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your 
fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of 
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public
