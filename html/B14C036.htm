place:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But they 
mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, 
until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no
remedy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore he 
brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the

that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in
writing, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus 
saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of 
heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, 
which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God 
be with him, and let him go up.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware -
