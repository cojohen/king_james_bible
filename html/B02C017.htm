all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of 
Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and
pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the people did chide 
with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto
them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people thirsted there for water; 
and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou 
hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle 
with thirst?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses 
cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost 
ready to stone me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the
elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine
hand, and go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I 
will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the 
rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And
Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And he called the name of the place Massah, and 
Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they 
tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

in Rephidim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses 
said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I 
will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So Joshua did as Moses had 
said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the
top of the hill.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when 
he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were
steady until the going down of the sun.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse 
it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek 
from under heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:</P></TD></TR><TR>
