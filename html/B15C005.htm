</P></TD><TD><P>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river,

commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter
came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this 
matter.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>The copy of the

Darius the king:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>They 
sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all 
peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Be it known unto 
the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great

this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of 
heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago,
which a great king of Israel builded and set up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of

Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away
into Babylon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But in 
the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree 
to build this house of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which 
Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them
into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of 
Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
had made governor;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is
in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came the same Sheshbazzar, 
and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since
that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
finished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's 
treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was
made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the 
king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
