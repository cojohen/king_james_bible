and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his 
brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings
thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

evening.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>They kept also 
the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt 
offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day 
required;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And afterward

They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and 
drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees 
from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus 
king of Persia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Now in 
the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the
second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of
Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all 
they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the
Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house 
of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then stood 
Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, 
together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, 
with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the 
ordinance of David king of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11>

unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward 
Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the 
LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But many of the priests and 
Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first 
house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people 
shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
