behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto 
Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he cried against the altar in the 
word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a
child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee
shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and
men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which 
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are
upon it shall be poured out.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of 
God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand 
from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth 
against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>The altar also was rent, and the 
ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had 
given by the word of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the 
face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me
again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored 
him again, and became as it was before.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, 
and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt 
give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread 
nor drink water in this place:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no 
bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So he went another way, 
and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his 
sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in 
Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to 
their father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way
the man of God went, which came from Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they 
saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And went after the man of God, and found him sitting 
under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from
Judah? And he said, I am.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, I may not return with 
thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee
in this place:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For it 
was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water 
there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>He said unto him, I am a prophet also 
as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring
him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But 
he lied unto him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as 
they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that 
brought him back:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, 
Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the 
commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk 
water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and 
drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy
fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came 
to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for
him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he was gone, a lion met him 
by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass
stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast 
in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in 
the city where the old prophet dwelt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way 
heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word 
of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath 
torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And he spake to 
his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went and found his carcass cast 
in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not 
eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29>
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid 
it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to
mourn and to bury him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, 
saying, Alas, my brother!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, 
saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is 
buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD 
against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places
which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>After this thing Jeroboam returned not 
from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the 
high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the
priests of the high places.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it 
off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
