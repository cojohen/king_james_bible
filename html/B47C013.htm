present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore 
have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Since ye seek a proof of 
Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For though he was crucified 
through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in 
him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in 
the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus 
Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

reprobates.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now I pray 
to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye
should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For we can do nothing against the truth, 
but for the truth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even 
your perfection.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use 
sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, 
and not to destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one 
mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</P></TD></TR>

salute you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>The grace 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy 
Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not
