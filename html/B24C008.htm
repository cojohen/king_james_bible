time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and 
the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the 
prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their 
graves:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And they shall 
spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they 
have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and 
whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be 
gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And death shall be chosen 
rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, 
which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of 
hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover thou 
shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall 
he turn away, and not return?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual 
backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>I hearkened and heard, but they spake 
not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?
every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, the stork in the heaven 
knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow 
observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>How do ye say, We 
are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; 
the pen of the scribes is in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they 
have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore will I give their wives 
unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one
from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the
prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For they have healed the hurt of the 
daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no 
peace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Were they 
ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, 
neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in
the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I will surely consume them, 
saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, 
and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away
from them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Why do we 
sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and
let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given
us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>We looked for peace, but no 
good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>The snorting of his horses was heard 
from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong 
ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the 
city, and those that dwell therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which 
will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

sorrow, my heart is faint in me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19> 
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because 
of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king 
in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with
strange vanities?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Is there no balm in Gilead; is 
there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my
people recovered?</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale -
