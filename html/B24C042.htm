Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before 
thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we 
are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to 
your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall 
answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they said to Jeremiah, 
The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>If ye will still abide in this 
land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and 
not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Be not afraid of the king 
of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I 
am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will shew mercies unto you, that 
he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But if ye say, We will not 
dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, No; but we will go into 
the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the 
trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And now therefore hear the word of the 
LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If 
ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Then it shall come to pass, 
that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, 
and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in 
Egypt; and there ye shall die.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt 
to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will 
bring upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath 
been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured 
forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration,
and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place 
no more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The LORD 
hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know 
certainly that I have admonished you this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me 
unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and
according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we
will do it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And now I 
have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD 
your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore know certainly that 
ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place 
whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
