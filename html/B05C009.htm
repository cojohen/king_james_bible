Chapter 9</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>
Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess 
nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to
heaven,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>A people great 
and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast 
heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Understand therefore this day, that the 
LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall 
destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive 
them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Speak not thou in thine heart, 
after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my 
righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the 
wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Not for thy righteousness, 
or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but
for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from 
before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy 
fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6> 
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this 
good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked 
people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Remember, and 
forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: 
from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came 
unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to 
wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>When I was gone up into the mount to 
receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD 
made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither 
did eat bread nor drink water:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the 
finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the
LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the 
assembly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came 
to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the 
two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get 
thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out
of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the
way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Furthermore the LORD spake unto 
me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked 
people:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Let me alone, 
that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will 
make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>So I turned and came down from the 
mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were 
in my two hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made
you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD
had commanded you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them 
before your eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I 
did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye 
sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to 
anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For I was 
afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against 
you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD was very angry 
with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same
time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And I took your 
sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and 
ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust 
thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at 
Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, 
saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled 
against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor
hearkened to his voice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus I fell down before 
the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the 
LORD had said he would destroy you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26> 
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy 
not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy
greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Remember thy servants, 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor 
to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, 
Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised 
them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the 
wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet they 
are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty 
power and by thy stretched out arm.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware
