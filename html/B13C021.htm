Chapter 21</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Joab and 
to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and
bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an 
hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all
my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a
cause of trespass to Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab 
departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joab gave the sum of the number 
of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and 
an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore
and ten thousand men that drew sword.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's 
word was abominable to Joab.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said unto God, I 
have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, 
do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD spake unto Gad, 
David's seer, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: 
choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>So Gad came to David, and said unto 
him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Either three years' famine; or three months to be 
destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh 
thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the 
land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. 
Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent 
me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said 
unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD;
for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>So the LORD sent 
pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And God sent an angel unto 
Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he
repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough,
stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of
Ornan the Jebusite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the 
earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over 
Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth,
fell upon their faces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be 
numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these
sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on 
me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be
plagued.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and
set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And David went up at the 
saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ornan turned back, and saw the 
angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing 
wheat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And as David 
came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, 
and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the 
place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: 
thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from 
the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And Ornan 
said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is 
good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the 
threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it 
all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And king David 
said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not 
take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without 
cost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>So David gave 
to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And David built there an altar unto 
the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the
LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt 
offering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath
thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>At that time 
when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan 
the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the 
wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the 
high place at Gibeon.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>
But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because 
of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
