Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by 
our gathering together unto him,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, 
nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at 
hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Let no man 
deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a
falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Who opposeth and exalteth 
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God 
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

with you, I told you these things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6>

time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For the mystery 
of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be 
taken out of the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the
spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Even him, whose coming is 
after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And with all deceivableness of 
unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the 
truth, that they might be saved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11> 
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that 
they should believe a lie:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had 
pleasure in unrighteousness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>

of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation 
through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our 
epistle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now our Lord 
Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath 
given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
