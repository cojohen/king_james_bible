Chapter 2</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in 
heaviness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I 
make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made 
sorry by me?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of
whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy 
of you all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For out of 
much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that 
ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more 
abundantly unto you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may
not overcharge you all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So that contrariwise ye 
ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be 
swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For to this end 
also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in 
all things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>To whom 
ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I 
forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest Satan should get an advantage 
of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's 
gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not 
Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into 
Macedonia.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now thanks 
be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest 
the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in 
them that are saved, and in them that perish:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and 
to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these
things?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For we are 
not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, 
in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
