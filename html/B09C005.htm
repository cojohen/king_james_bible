arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to
the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms 
of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left
to him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore

our god.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>They sent 
therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said,
What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the
ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark 
of the God of Israel about thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9>

men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret 
parts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore they

it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there
was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the
