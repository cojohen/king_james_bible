Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so 
stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of 
the same mind in the Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured 
with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, 
whose names are in the book of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4> 
<H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.</TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Let your moderation be known unto 
all men. The Lord is at hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication 
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And the peace of God, which passeth all 
understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Finally, brethren, whatsoever 
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are 
of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on
these things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Those 
things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, 
do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the 
last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but
ye lacked opportunity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever 
state I am, therewith to be content.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every 
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both
to abound and to suffer need.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding ye have well 
done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the 
beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated 
with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once 
and again unto my necessity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to 
your account.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But I 
have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things 
which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,
wellpleasing to God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by 
Christ Jesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. 
The brethren which are with me greet you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of 
Caesar's household.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P> 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
