shew them a sign from heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4>

fair weather: for the sky is red.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky 
is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but
can ye not discern the signs of the times?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
And he left them, and departed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten 
to take bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and
of the Sadducees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no 
bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Which when Jesus 
perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among 
yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, 
but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the
Son of man am?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others,
Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</TD></TR><TR><TD

Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art 
thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I 
will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give unto thee 
the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus
the Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>From that 
time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto 
Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, 
and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, 
saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But he turned, and said unto 
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou
savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Jesus unto his 
disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his 
cross, and follow me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his 
life for my sake shall find it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26> 
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, 
and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>For the Son of man shall 
come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every 
man according to his works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not 
taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</P></TD></TR>
