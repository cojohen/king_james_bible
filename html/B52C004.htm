Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, 
that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye
would abound more and more.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For this is the will of God, even 
your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>That every one of you should know how to 
possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

which know not God:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the 
Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and 
testified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For God hath 
not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but 
God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And indeed ye do it 
toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you,
brethren, that ye increase more and more;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may walk honestly toward 
them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even 
as others which have no hope.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also 
which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent 
them which are asleep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>

first:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Then we which

meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
