many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things 
which are most surely believed among us,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>It seemed good to me also, having had

order, most excellent Theophilus,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>

<TD><P>THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named 
Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, 
and her name was Elisabeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments 
and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7>
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and 
they both were now well stricken in years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's 
office before God in the order of his course,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot 
was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the whole multitude of the people 
were praying without at the time of incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord 
standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and 
fear fell upon him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P> 
But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and
thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name
John.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt 
have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>For he shall be great in the sight of 
the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled 
with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn 
to the Lord their God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the 
hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the 
just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall 
I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel answering said 
unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak 
unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to

believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people waited for 
Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he came out, he could not 
speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: 
for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of 
his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And after those days his wife 
Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the sixth month the

David:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall 
reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no

unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4></TD><TD><P>And the angel answered and said unto 
her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall 
overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee 
shall be called the Son of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36> 
<H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son 
in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called 
barren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V37><H4>37</H4></TD><TD><P>For with God

Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41> 
<H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation 
of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy 
Ghost:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>And she spake 
out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is

<TD><P>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>For, lo, as soon as the

<H4>49</H4></TD><TD><P>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is
