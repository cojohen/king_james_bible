the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in 
the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of 
Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the 
wilderness of Ziph.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But 
David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the 
wilderness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>David 
therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And David arose, and came 
to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, 
and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, 
and the people pitched round about him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, 
and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down
with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>So David and Abishai came 
to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and
his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay
round about him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: 
now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth
at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who 
can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>David said furthermore, 
As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or 
he shall descend into battle, and perish.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand 
against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is 
at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So David took the spear and the cruse 
of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor
knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from
the LORD was fallen upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an 
hill afar off; a great space being between them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son 
of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who
art thou that criest to the king?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is 
like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?
for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This thing is not good that thou 
hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept
your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and 
the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy 
voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said, Wherefore doth my 
lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in 
mine hand?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If
the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if
they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have
driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, 
serve other gods.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for 
the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a
partridge in the mountains.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no 
more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, 
I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And David answered and said, Behold the king's 
spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>The LORD render to every man his 
righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to 
day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, as thy life 
was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the 
eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Saul said to David, Blessed 
be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still 
prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</P></TD></TR>
