there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, 
and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship 
therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But the court 
which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto 
the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two 
months.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give 
power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and

mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in
this manner be killed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their 
prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the
earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they shall have finished their testimony, the 
beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and 
shall overcome them, and kill them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, 
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they of 
the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies 
three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in 
graves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And they that 
dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send 
gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on 
the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And after 
three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they

tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven 
thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of 
heaven.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>The second 
woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

reigned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they
