<TD><P>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had 
strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to 
pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up 
against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>With twelve hundred chariots, and 
threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with 
him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took the fenced cities which 
pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the 
princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,
and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore 
have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled 
themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, 
the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; 
therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and
my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless they shall be 
his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of 
the countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of 
the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he
carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Instead of which king Rehoboam made 
shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard,
that kept the entrance of the king's house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, 
the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard 
chamber.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he 
humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not 
destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself 
in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he 
began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his 
mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to 
seek the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of 
Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there
were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, 
and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his 
stead.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale - John M.
