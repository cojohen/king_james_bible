there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the

manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever
eateth it shall be cut off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>

was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he
shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until 
the even: then shall he be clean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16>
