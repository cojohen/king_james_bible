say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's,

thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Lift up thine 
eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the
ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast 
polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath 
played the harlot.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And

not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to

am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR>
