<TD><P>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the

land of Gilead, unto Dan,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land 
of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of

And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto 
Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee 
to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>So Moses the servant of the LORD died

this day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses was 
an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his 
natural force abated.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of 
the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children 
of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And there arose not a prophet

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>In all the signs and the wonders, 
which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his 
servants, and to all his land,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>
