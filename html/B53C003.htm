Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, 
and be glorified, even as it is with you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked 
men: for all men have not faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from 
evil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And we have 
confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things 
which we command you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient
waiting for Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye 
withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after
the tradition which he received of us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we 
behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but 
wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable
to any of you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Not 
because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow 
us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For even when we 
were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither 
should he eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>For we 
hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, 
but are busybodies.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that 
with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man obey not 
our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he 
may be ashamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Yet 
count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the Lord of peace himself give you 
peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>The salutation of Paul with mine own 
hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you all. Amen.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale
