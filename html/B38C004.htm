said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a 
candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps 
thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top 
thereof:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And two olive

<TD><P>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD 
unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith
the LORD of hosts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Who 
art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he 
shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace
unto it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the 
word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are 
the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Then answered I, and said unto 
him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and 
upon the left side thereof?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive 
branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of
themselves?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he 
answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my

These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</P></TD>
