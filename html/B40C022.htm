Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a 
certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And sent forth his servants to call them that were 
bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them 
which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings 
are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>But they made light of it, and went 
their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And the remnant took his servants, and 
entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he 
sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their 
city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Then saith he to 
his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not 
worthy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Go ye therefore 
into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So those servants went out 
into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad 
and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the king came in to see the 
guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto him, Friend, how 
camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said the king to the 
servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer 
darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For many are called, but few are 
chosen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then went the 
Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sent out unto him 
their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, 
and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou 
regardest not the person of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give 
tribute unto Caesar, or not?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye 
hypocrites?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Shew me 
the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he saith unto them, Whose is this 
image and superscription?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD>
<TD><P>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto 
Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are 
God's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>When they had 
heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>The same day came to him the 
Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Master, Moses said, 
If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up 
seed unto his brother.

scriptures, nor the power of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30>
