And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of 
wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save 
Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much 
trembling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And my 
speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in 
demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, 
but in the power of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of 
this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But we speak the wisdom of God in a 
mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our 
glory:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Which none of 
the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have
crucified the Lord of glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>But as it is written, 
<A HREF=B23C064.htm#V4>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have 
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that 
love him.</A>
<BR>Isa 64:4
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But God 
hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, 
yea, the deep things of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which 
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Now we have received, not 
the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the 
things that are freely given to us of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Which things also we speak, not in the words which 
man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual 
things with spiritual.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they 
are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are 
spiritually discerned.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no 
man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>
<A HREF=B23C040.htm#V14>For who hath 
known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?</A> But we have the mind of
Christ.
