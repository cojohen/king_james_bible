Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted
in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy
salvation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>There is 
none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock 
like our God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Talk no 
more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the 
LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>The bows of the mighty men are broken, 
and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>They that were full have hired out themselves for 
bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven;
and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down 
to the grave, and bringeth up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth 
up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>He raiseth up the 
poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them 
among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of 
the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>He will keep the feet of his saints, and 
the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man 
prevail.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he 
thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall 
give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his 
house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the sons of Eli were sons 
of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13> 
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man 
offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething,
with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, 
or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they 
did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Also before they burnt the fat, the 
priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast 
for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man said unto him, 
Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul
desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if
not, I will take it by force.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for 
men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, 
girded with a linen ephod.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from 
year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly 
sacrifice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And Eli 
blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman 
for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD visited 
Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the 
child Samuel grew before the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22> 
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all 
Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23> 
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your 
evil dealings by all this people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24> 
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the 
LORD's people to transgress.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a 
man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they 
hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the child 
Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a man of 
God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto 
the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And did I choose him out of 
all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn 
incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy 
father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice 
and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy 
sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of 
Israel my people?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the 
house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be 
it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me 
shall be lightly esteemed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31><H4>31</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of 
thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And thou shalt see an enemy in 
my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall 
not be an old man in thine house for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from 
mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all 
the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>And this shall be a sign unto 
thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day 
they shall die both of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to 
that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; 
and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is 
left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a
morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' 
offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
