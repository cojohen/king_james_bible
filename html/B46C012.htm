Chapter 12</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you 
ignorant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye know that 
ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore I give you to 
understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed:
and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Now there are diversities of 
gifts, but the same Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And there are diversities of 
operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But the manifestation of the Spirit is 
given to every man to profit withal.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another 
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts 
of healing by the same Spirit;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another 
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the 
interpretation of tongues:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to 
every man severally as he will.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the 
members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For by one Spirit are we all 
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For the body is not one member, but 
many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>If the foot 
shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not 
of the body?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And if 
the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it 
therefore not of the body?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole 
were hearing, where were the smelling?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But now hath God set the members every one of them in 
the body, as it hath pleased him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19> 
<H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But now are they many members, 
yet but one body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to 
the feet, I have no need of you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22> 
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more 
feeble, are necessary:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon 
these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant 
comeliness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For our 
comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having
given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>That there should be no schism in the 
body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And whether one member suffer, 
all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members 
rejoice with it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And God hath set some in the church, 
first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, 
then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>Are all apostles? are all 
prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Have all the gifts of healing? do all 
speak with tongues? do all interpret?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto 
you a more excellent way.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for
