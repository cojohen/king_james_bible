giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in 
their houses;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou

slayer may flee thither.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD>

live: Whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time 
past;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>As when a man 
goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a
stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, 
and lighteth upon his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those 
cities, and live:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Lest 
the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and 
overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy
of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy
fathers;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>If thou shalt 
keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love
the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three 
cities more for thee, beside these three:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.</P></TD>

neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him 
mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
