the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door
in the heat of the day;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when 
he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward
the ground,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And said, 
My LORD, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, 
from thy servant:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Let a 
little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves 
under the tree:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall
pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as 
thou hast said.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three
measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and 
fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to 
dress it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And he took 
butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; 
and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And they said unto him, Where is Sarah 
thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And
Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of 
women.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore 
Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have 
pleasure, my lord being old also?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13>

<TD><P>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, 
Nay; but thou didst laugh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham 
went with them to bring them on the way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

which I do;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Seeing 
that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations 
of the earth shall be blessed in him?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice 
and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD 
said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is 
very grievous;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I will 
go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of 
it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And the men turned their faces from thence, and 
went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous 
that are therein?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P> 
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the 
wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee:
Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty

dust and ashes:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy
all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I 
will not destroy it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>
