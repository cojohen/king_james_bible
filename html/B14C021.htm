Chapter 21</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in 
the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he had brethren the sons of 
Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And their father gave them great 
gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in 
Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when Jehoram was risen 
up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his
brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Jehoram was thirty and two years old 
when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he walked in the way of the 
kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab 
to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit the LORD would not 
destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with 
David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>In his days the Edomites 
revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Jehoram went forth with his 
princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the 
Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So the Edomites revolted from 
under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt 
from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover he made high 
places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to 
commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the 
prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast 
not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king 
of Judah,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>But hast 
walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of 
Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better 
than thyself:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, 
with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy 
wives, and all thy goods:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy 
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the LORD stirred up against 
Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the 
Ethiopians:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that
was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there
was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And after all this the LORD smote 
him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the 
end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of 
sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his
fathers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Thirty and 
two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight 
years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city
of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public
