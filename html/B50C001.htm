Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ 
Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God 
our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Always in every prayer of mine 
for you all making request with joy,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5> 
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until 
now;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Being confident of 
this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it 
until the day of Jesus Christ:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you 
in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation 
of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all 
in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in 
knowledge and in all judgment;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere 
and without offence till the day of Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which 
are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But I would ye should understand, 
brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto
the furtherance of the gospel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all 
other places;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more
bold to speak the word without fear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also 
of good will:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>The one 
preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my 
bonds:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But the other 
of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>What then? notwithstanding, every way, 
whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, 
yea, and will rejoice.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and 
the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that 
in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now 
also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by
death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>For to me to 
live is Christ, and to die is gain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22> 
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet 
what I shall choose I wot not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be 
with Christ; which is far better:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24> 
<H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And having this 
confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your
furtherance and joy of faith;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my 
coming to you again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether 
I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye 
stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the
gospel;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And in 
nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of 
perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>For unto you it is given in the behalf 
of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Having the same conflict 
which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public
