Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and 
five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
out before the children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father 
had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab 
king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built altars in the 
house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built altars for all 
the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he made his son pass through the 
fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar 
spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to
provoke him to anger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which
the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in 
Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name
for ever:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither will 
I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their
fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded 
them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But they hearkened not: and 
Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD 
destroyed before the children of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, 
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Because 
Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly 
above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah 
also to sin with his idols:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing 
such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears 
shall tingle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house
of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and 
turning it upside down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into 
the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all
their enemies;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to 
anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this
day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover 
Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one
end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that 
which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he 
did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18> 
<H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the 
garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his 
stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Amon was 
twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in 
Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of 
Jotbah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>And he did 
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And he walked in all the 
way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and 
worshipped them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the people of the 
land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the 
land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he was buried in his sepulchre 
in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</P></TD></TR>
