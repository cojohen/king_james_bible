service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to 
make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the

congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do 
unto the Levites touching their charge.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
