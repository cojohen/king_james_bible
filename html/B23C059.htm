heavy, that it cannot hear:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins 
have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your 
fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered 
perverseness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>None 
calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and
speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed 
breaketh out into a viper.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves

<A HREF=B45C003.htm#V15>Their
