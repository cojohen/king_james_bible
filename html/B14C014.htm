<TD><P>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: 
and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten 
years.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa did that 
which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For he took away the altars of the 
strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the 
groves:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And commanded 
Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the 
commandment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Also he 
took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and
the kingdom was quiet before him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6> 
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and 
he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us 
build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, 
while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we 
have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and 
prospered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa had 
an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred 
thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and 
fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And there came out against them Zerah 
the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots;
and came unto Mareshah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the 
valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11> 
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is 
nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: 
help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against 
this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>So the LORD smote the 
Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And Asa and the people that were 
with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they 
could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and
before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And they smote all the cities round 
about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the
cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried 
away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
