they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of
Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the 
fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of
Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And the whole 
congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the
wilderness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the 
LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat 
bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill 
this whole assembly with hunger.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven 
for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that 
I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And it shall come to pass, that on the 
sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as 
much as they gather daily.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye 
shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning, then ye 
shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against
the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, This shall be, when the 
LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to
the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against 
him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses spake 
unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near 
before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the 
whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the 
wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD spake unto Moses, 
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>I have heard 
the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye 
shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD your God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13> 
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and 
covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the dew that lay was 
gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, 
as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one 
to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto 
them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>This is the thing which the LORD hath 
commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every
man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which
are in his tents.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they did mete it with an 
omer, 
<A HREF=B47C008.htm#V15>he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had 
no lack;</A> they gathered every man according to his eating.

VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it 
till the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it
until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with 
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun
waxed hot, it melted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>
And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, 
two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told 
Moses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And he said 
unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the
holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe 
that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept
until the morning.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink,
neither was there any worm therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25> 
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto 
the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh 
day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, that there went 
out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found
none.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And the LORD 
said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>See, for that the LORD 
hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread
of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on 
the seventh day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
the people rested on the seventh day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V31><H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: 
and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made 
with honey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses 
said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be 
kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you 
in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And Moses said unto Aaron, 
Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the 
LORD, to be kept for your generations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before 
the Testimony, to be kept.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came 
to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of
the land of Canaan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
