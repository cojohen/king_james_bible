Chapter 29</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he 
reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah,
the daughter of Zechariah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all 
that David his father had done.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the 
doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and 
gathered them together into the east street,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now 
yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry
forth the filthiness out of the holy place.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was 
evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned
away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Also they have shut up the 
doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor
offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was 
upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to 
astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the 
sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for
this.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Now it is in 
mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce
wrath may turn away from us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand 
before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn 
incense.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the 
Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the 
sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and 
Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah,
and Eden the son of Joah:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; 
Zechariah, and Mattaniah:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; 
Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, 
according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse
the house of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to 
cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple
of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it,
to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Now they began on the first day of the first month to 
sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the
LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the 
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, 
We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, 
with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels 
thereof.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover all 
the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, 
have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Hezekiah 
the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the 
house of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he 
goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for 
Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the
altar of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it 
on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood 
upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon 
the altar.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And they 
brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the
congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And the priests killed them, and they made 
reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering 
should be made for all Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with 
psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad
the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD 
by his prophets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the 
trumpets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the 
burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and
with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>And all the congregation worshipped, 
and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until 
the burnt offering was finished.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29> 
<H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that 
were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the 
princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of 
David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they 
bowed their heads and worshipped.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V31> 
<H4>31</H4></TD><TD><P>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated 
yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings 
into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and
thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD><TD><P>And the number of the burnt 
offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an
hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P>But the priests were too few, so 
that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the 
Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had 
sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify 
themselves than the priests.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the 
peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the 
service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V36><H4>36</H4></TD><TD><P>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that 
God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
