saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Enquire, I pray 
thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against

works, that he may go up from us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>

Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, 
wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans,
which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of 
this city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And I myself 
will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in 
anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this 
city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into 
the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge
of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</P></TD>

you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
