delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver 
to the chief priests and elders,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4>

and departed, and went and hanged himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of 
blood.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And they took 
counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</P></TD>

<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, 
saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou 
sayest.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And when he 
was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest 
thou not how many things they witness against thee?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch 
that the governor marvelled greatly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15>
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the 
people a prisoner, whom they would.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16> 
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore when they were 
gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? 
Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>When he was set down on 
the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with 
that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>But the chief 
priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and 
destroy Jesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I 
release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the governor said, Why, 
what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be 
crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>When 
Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he 
took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of 
the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

us, and on our children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he 
delivered him to be crucified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and 
gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

robe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P>And when they 
had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his 
right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, 
King of the Jews!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</P></TD></TR><TR>

him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led
him away to crucify him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V32><H4>32</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they 
compelled to bear his cross.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V33><H4>33</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, 
a place of a skull,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V34><H4>34</H4></TD><TD><P> 
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted
thereof, he would not drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V35><H4>35</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, <A HREF=B19C022.htm#V18>They parted my garments 
among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</A>

accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

wagging their heads,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V40><H4>40</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 
save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V41><H4>41</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise also the chief priests 
mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V42><H4>42</H4></TD><TD><P>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be 
the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe 
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V43><H4>43</H4></TD><TD><P>He trusted in 
God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of 
God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V44><H4>44</H4></TD><TD><P>The thieves 
also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</P></TD></TR><TR>

darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

<A HREF=B19C022.htm#V1>My God, my God, why

<TD><P>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth 
for Elias.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V48><H4>48</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and 
put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

come to save him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V50><H4>50</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V51><H4>51</H4></TD><TD><P>And, behold, the veil of 
the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did
quake, and the rocks rent;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V52><H4>52</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept 
arose,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V53><H4>53</H4></TD><TD><P>And came out 
of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared 
unto many.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V54><H4>54</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when 
the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, 
and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was 
the Son of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V55><H4>55</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, 
ministering unto him:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V56><H4>56</H4></TD><TD><P>
Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the 
mother of Zebedees children.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V57><H4>57</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named 
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V59><H4>59</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a 
clean linen cloth,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V60><H4>60</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he
rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V61><H4>61</H4></TD><TD><P>And there was Mary Magdalene, and 
the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V62><H4>62</H4></TD><TD><P>Now the next day, that followed the day of the 
preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V63><H4>63</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, Sir, we remember 
that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise 
again.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V64><H4>64</H4></TD><TD><P>Command 
therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his 
disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is 
risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V65><H4>65</H4></TD><TD><P>Pilate said unto them, Ye have 
a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V66><H4>66</H4></TD><TD><P>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing 
the stone, and setting a watch.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware -
