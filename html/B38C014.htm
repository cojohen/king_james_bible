Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst 
of thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For I will 
gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, 
and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go 
forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from
the city.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall 
the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the
day of battle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And his 
feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before
Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst
thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great
valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
toward the south.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains
shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the
earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, 
and all the saints with thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>

clear, nor dark:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But it 
shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it 
shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and 
half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</P></TD>

turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be 
lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of
the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the
king's winepresses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but
Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12>
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all 
the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away
while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their 
holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

hand of his neighbour.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD>

round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great 
abundance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And so 
shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass,

that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem 
shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and
to keep the feast of tabernacles.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17>

them shall be no rain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>

sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day
there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</P></TD>
