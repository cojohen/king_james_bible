Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint 
not;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But have renounced 
the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the 
word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves 
to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are 
lost:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>In whom the god 
of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light 
of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For we preach not 
ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' 
sake.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For God, who 
commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to 
give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But we have 
this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of 
God, and not of us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>We 
are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in
despair;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Persecuted, 
but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</P></TD>

alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might
be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

faith, according as it is written,

also believe, and therefore speak;

also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For our light 
affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD>

not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are 
not seen are eternal.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for
