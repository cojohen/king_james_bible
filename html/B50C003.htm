the concision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For we 
are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ 
Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
which are before,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>I
