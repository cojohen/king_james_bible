For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in 
vain:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>But even after 
that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at
Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much 
contention.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For our 
exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But as we were allowed of God to be 
put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, 
which trieth our hearts.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke 
of covetousness; God is witness:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we 
might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But we were gentle among you, even as a 
nurse cherisheth her children:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have 
imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because 
ye were dear unto us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, 
because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the
gospel of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye are 
witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved 
ourselves among you that believe:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11> 
<H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one 
of you, as a father doth his children,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you 
unto his kingdom and glory.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye 
received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word
of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also 
in you that believe.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P> 
For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are 
in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, 
even as they have of the Jews:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have 
persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Forbidding us to speak to the 
Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath 
is come upon them to the uttermost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17> 
<H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in 
presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with
great desire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan 
hindered us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For what 
is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of 
our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20>
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye are our glory and joy.</TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
