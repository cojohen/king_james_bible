verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly
sanctuary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For there 
was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, 
and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is 
called the Holiest of all;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round 
about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod 
that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the 
mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Now when these things were thus 
ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the
service of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, 
which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that 
the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first 
tabernacle was yet standing:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered 
both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service 
perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers 
washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
reformation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>But 
Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more
perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this
building;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither by 
the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the 
holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For if the blood of bulls and of 
goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the 
purifying of the flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit 
offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to
serve the living God?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of 
death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first 
testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal 
inheritance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the
testator.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For a 
testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all 
while the testator liveth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For when Moses had spoken 
every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of 
calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled
both the book, and all the people,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20> 
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Saying, 
<A HREF=B02C024.htm#V8>This is the blood of the testament which God hath 
enjoined unto you.</A>
<BR>Exod 24:8
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of 
the ministry.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of 
blood is no remission.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens 
should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better
sacrifices than these.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are 
the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence 
of God for us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Nor 
yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the
holy place every year with blood of others;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>For then must he often have suffered since the 
foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after 
this the judgment:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>So 
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for 
him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</P></TD></TR>
