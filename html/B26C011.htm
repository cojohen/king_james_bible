Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the
LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five
and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the 
son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Which say, It is not near; let us build 
houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore prophesy against them, 
prophesy, O son of man.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith 
the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come 
into your mind, every one of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6> 
<H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled 
the streets thereof with the slain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7> 
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid 
in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I 
will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

you, saith the Lord GOD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the 
hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will 
judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>This city shall not be 
your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will
judge you in the border of Israel:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in 
my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of
the heathen that are round about you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah 
the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud
voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of 
Israel?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the 
word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of 
thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this 
land given in possession.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off 
among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet 
will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall 
come.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say, 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble 
you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the
land of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things 
thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will give them one heart, and I 
will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their
flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine 
ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their 
God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>But as for them 
whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their
abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord
GOD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Then did the 
cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the 
God of Israel was over them above.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23> 
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, 
and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>Afterwards the spirit took me up, 
and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the
captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>Then I spake unto them of the 
captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
