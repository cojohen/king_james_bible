Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And David took 
more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</P></TD></TR><TR>

<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the

him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>So they came up to Baalperazim; and 
David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies 
by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name
of that place Baalperazim.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4>

the Philistines.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>
