formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; 
and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my
blessing upon thine offspring:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water 
courses.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>One shall say, 
I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and 
another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the 
name of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus 
saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the

my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not
any.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>They that make a 
graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not
profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may 
be ashamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Who hath

together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed 
together.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>The smith 
with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and

out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the
compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a
man; that it may remain in the house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and 
the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he
planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take 
thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he 
maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down 
thereto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>He burneth 
part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast,

seen the fire:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down

thou art my god.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>They

there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire;

eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall 
down to the stock of a tree?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4>

thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Sing, O ye 
heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break 
forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the 
LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

myself;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>That

up the decayed places thereof:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4>
