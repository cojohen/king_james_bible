princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto 
the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king 
of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found

fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, 
and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an
adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? 
should it not be with the heads of these men?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy
going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have 
not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: 
nevertheless the lords favor thee not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A
