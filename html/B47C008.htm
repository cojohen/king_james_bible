Chapter 8</H1></CENTER></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V1><H4>1</H4></TD><TD><P>
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the 
churches of Macedonia;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P> 
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their 
deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>For to their power, I bear record, yea, 
and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Praying us with much intreaty that we 
would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to 
the saints.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And this 
they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and 
unto us by the will of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also 
finish in you the same grace also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7> 
<H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, 
and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound 
in this grace also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>I 
speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to 
prove the sincerity of your love.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he 
was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might 
be rich.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And herein I 
give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only 
to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there 
was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which 
ye have.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For if there 
be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not 
according to that he hath not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But by an equality, that now at 
this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance 
also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>As it is written, 
<A HREF=B02C016.htm#V18>He that had 
gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no
lack.</A>
<BR>Exod 16:18
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But thanks be 
to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For indeed he accepted 
the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto 
you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And we have sent 
with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the 
churches;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And not 
that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this 
grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and 
declaration of your ready mind:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20> 
<H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance 
which is administered by us:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but 
also in the sight of men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD>
<TD><P>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved 
diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence
which I have in you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning 
you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches,
and the glory of Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, 
and of our boasting on your behalf.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware
