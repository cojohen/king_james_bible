Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at 
Athens alone;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And sent 
Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the
gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your
faith:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>That no man 
should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed 
thereunto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For verily, 
when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation;
even as it came to pass, and ye know.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5>
<H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know 
your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be
in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But now when 
Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and 
charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to
see us, as we also to see you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction 
and distress by your faith:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, 
for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Night and day praying exceedingly 
that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your
faith?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Now God 
himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the Lord make you to 
increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we
do toward you:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>To the 
end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our 
Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</P></TD></TR>
