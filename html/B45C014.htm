that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>For one believeth that he

eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God

art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or

<TD><P>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that 
regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, 
eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the
Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

himself.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>For whether we 
live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether 
we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us not therefore judge one 
another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an 
occasion to fall in his brother's way.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

spoken of:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>For the 
kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in
the Holy Ghost.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of 
men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>Let us therefore 
follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may 
edify another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil

And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for
whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware
