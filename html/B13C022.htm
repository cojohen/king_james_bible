the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house 
of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>And David 
prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for

magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore
now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</P></TD>

son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD 
my God:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But the word of 
the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made 
great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed 
much blood upon the earth in my sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>He shall build

fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning 
Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Now, behold, in my trouble I 
have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold,

mayest add thereto.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone

before the LORD, and before his people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house
that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
