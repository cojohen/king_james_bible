<TD><P>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And he went out to meet Asa, and said 
unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you,
while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye
forsake him, he will forsake you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3> 
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and 
without a teaching priest, and without law.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God 
of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>And in those times there was no peace to him that went 
out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants 
of the countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all 
adversity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Be ye strong 
therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</P></TD>
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And when Asa heard these 
words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the
abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the
LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers 
with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him 
out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with
him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>So they gathered 
themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of 
the reign of Asa.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, 
seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God 
of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>That whosoever would not seek the LORD 
God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or 
woman.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And they sware 
unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with 
cornets.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And all 
Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought 
him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them 
rest round about.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being 
queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and 
stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: 
nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And he brought into the house of God 
the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, 
silver, and gold, and vessels.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the 
reign of Asa.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale - John
