When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to 
possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the 
Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And when the LORD thy God 
shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy
them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them:</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither shalt thou make 
marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his 
daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>For they will turn away thy son from following me, that 
they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against 
you, and destroy thee suddenly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and 
break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven 
images with fire.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen 
thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the
face of the earth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>The 
LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in 
number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But because the LORD loved you, and 
because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the 
LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of 
bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the 
faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep 
his commandments to a thousand generations;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to 
his face.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou shalt 
therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I 
command thee this day, to do them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12> 
<H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these 
judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee
the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And he will love thee, and bless thee, 
and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of 
thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and 
the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give
thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou shalt be 
blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you,
or among your cattle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>
And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the 
evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon 
all them that hate thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver 
thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their
gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

more than I; how can I dispossess them?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>The great temptations which 
thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the
stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD 
thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover the LORD thy God will send 
the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, 
be destroyed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou 
shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty
God and terrible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: 
thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase 
upon thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>But the 
LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty 
destruction, until they be destroyed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and 
thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to 
stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn 
with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD 
thy God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Neither 
shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing 
like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for 
it is a cursed thing.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for
