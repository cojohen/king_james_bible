fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus 
with me also.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And I 
went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach 
among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any 
means I should run, or had run, in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was 
compelled to be circumcised:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in 
privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might 
bring us into bondage:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P> 
To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the 
gospel might continue with you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it 
maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to
be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the 
uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was 
unto Peter;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>(For he 
that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the
same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be 
pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and
Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and 
they unto the circumcision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I 
also was forward to do.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he 
was to be blamed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>For 
before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when 
they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of
the circumcision.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was 
carried away with their dissimulation.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according 
to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a 
Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why 
compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>We who are Jews by nature, and not 
sinners of the Gentiles,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the 
faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be 
justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the 
works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we 
ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God 
forbid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For if I 
build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>For I through the law am 
dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not 
I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live 
by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>I do not frustrate the grace 
of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</P></TD>
