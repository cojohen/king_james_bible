Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and 
prophesy against it,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against 
thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most 
desolate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>I will lay 
thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the 
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Because thou hast 
had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by 
the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their
iniquity had an end:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and
blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall 
pursue thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Thus will 
I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and 
him that returneth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, 
and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I will make thee perpetual 
desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the
LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Because thou 
hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will 
possess it; whereas the LORD was there:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even 
do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used
out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I 
have judged thee.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies 
which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid
desolate, they are given us to consume.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

<A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the 
house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be 
desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know 
that I am the LORD.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware - Not for Sale
