To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of

month.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then the word of 
the LORD came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest 
forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the 
nations.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>Then said I, 
Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

command thee thou shalt speak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4>

the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, 
Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

to build, and to plant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest 
thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, 
What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is
toward the north.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all 
the inhabitants of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, 
saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at 
the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round 
about, and against all the cities of Judah.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other 
gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and 
speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I 
confound thee before them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4>

pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah,
against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the 
people of the land.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>

I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public
