a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good 
work.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>A bishop then 
must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, 
given to hospitality, apt to teach;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>

patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4>

<TD><P>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation 
of the devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Moreover 
he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into 
reproach and the snare of the devil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8> 
<H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given 
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

conscience.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>And let 
these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being 
found blameless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Even 
so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all 
things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Let the 
deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses 
well.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For they that 
have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and 
great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
