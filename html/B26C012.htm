word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious 
house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear
not: for they are a rebellious house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3>
<H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and 
remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another 
place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious 
house.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Then shalt thou 
bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou
shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into 
captivity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Dig thou 
through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>In their sight shalt thou bear it upon 
thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face,
that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of 
Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>And I did so as 
I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and 
in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the 
twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And in the morning came the word of the 
LORD unto me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, 
What doest thou?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Say 
thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in 
Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>Say, I am your sign: like as I have 
done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into
captivity.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And the 
prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and 
shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall
cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>My net also will I spread upon him, 
and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land
of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will scatter toward 
every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will
draw out the sword after them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them 
among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>But I will leave a few men of them 
from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare 
all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know 
that I am the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink 
thy water with trembling and with carefulness;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the 
Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall 
eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that 
her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of 
all them that dwell therein.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land 
shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And the word of the LORD came unto me, 
saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, 
what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are
prolonged, and every vision faileth?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23>
<H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this 
proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say 
unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>For there shall be no more any 
vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>For I am the LORD: I will speak, 
and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more
prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will 
perform it, saith the Lord GOD.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26> 
<H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.</TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4></TD><TD><P>Son of man, behold, they of the house 
of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he
prophesieth of the times that are far off.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There 
shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken 
shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware
