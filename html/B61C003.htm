second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your 
pure minds by way of remembrance:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2> 
<H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by 
the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and 
Saviour:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Knowing this 
first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own 
lusts,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>And saying, 
Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all
things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For this they willingly are ignorant 
of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out 
of the water and in the water:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, 
perished:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But the 
heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, 
reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But, beloved, be 
not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand 
years, and a thousand years as one day.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men 
count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should 
perish, but that all should come to repentance.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the 
night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the 
elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of 
persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Looking for and hasting unto the 
coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, 
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for 
<A HREF=B23C065.htm#V17>
new heavens and a new earth,</A> wherein dwelleth righteousness.
<BR>Isa 65:17,
<A HREF=B23C066.htm#V22>66:22</A>
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye 
look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without 
spot, and blameless.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P> 
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our 
beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written 
unto you;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>As also in 
all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things
hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as 
they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know 
these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and 
Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</P></TD></TR>
