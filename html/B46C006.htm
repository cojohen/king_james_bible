Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, 
and not before the saints?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world 
shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</P></TD></TR>

pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the
church.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>I speak to your 
shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall 
be able to judge between his brethren?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A

the unbelievers.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Now 
therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with 
another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer 
yourselves to be defrauded?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>
<TD><P>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor

mankind,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Nor thieves,

<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall 
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the
Lord; and the Lord for the body.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14>

Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the 
members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</P></TD></TR>
