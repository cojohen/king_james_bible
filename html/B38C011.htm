the vintage is come down.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is

I will not deliver them.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD>

Bands; and I fed the flock.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD>

the flesh of another.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>
And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my 
covenant which I had made with all the people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

the potter in the house of the LORD.

that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh
