he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith

that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be 
imputed unto them also:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD>

not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness
of faith.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>For if they 
which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none
