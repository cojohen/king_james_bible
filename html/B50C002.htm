If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any 
fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, 
having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>Let nothing be done through strife or 
vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than 
themselves.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>Look not 
every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Let this mind be in you, 
which was also in Christ Jesus:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with 
God:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>But made himself 
of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the 
likeness of men:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto 
death, even the death of the cross.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9> 
<H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name 
which is above every name:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, 
and things in earth, and things under the earth;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus 
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not 
as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own 
salvation with fear and trembling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13> 
<H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his 
good pleasure.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Do all 
things without murmurings and disputings:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, 
without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye 
shine as lights in the world;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16><H4>16</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of 
Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>Yea, and if I be offered upon the 
sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</P></TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>For the same cause also do ye 
joy, and rejoice with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD>
<TD><P>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I 
also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>For I have no man likeminded, who will 
naturally care for your state.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>But ye know the proof of 
him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>Him therefore I hope to 
send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD><TD><P>But I trust in the Lord that I also 
myself shall come shortly.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25><H4>25</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, 
and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that 
ministered to my wants.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had 
heard that he had been sick.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V27><H4>27</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and 
not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V28><H4>28</H4></TD><TD><P>I sent him therefore the 
more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be
the less sorrowful.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V29><H4>29</H4></TD><TD><P> 
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in 
reputation:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V30><H4>30</H4></TD><TD><P>Because 
for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to 
supply your lack of service toward me.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain
