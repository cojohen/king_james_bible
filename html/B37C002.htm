by Haggai the prophet, saying,</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4>
</P></TD><TD><P>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law,

unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>Then 
answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, 
saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer
there is unclean.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15><H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was 
laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V16><H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of 
twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw
out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the
earth;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22><H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will

in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
sword of his brother.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my
