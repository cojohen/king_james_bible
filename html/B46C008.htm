Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. 
Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he 
knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V3><H4>3</H4></TD><TD><P>But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4></TD><TD><P>As concerning therefore the 
eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that 
an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>For though there be that 
are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and 
lords many,)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD><TD><P>But to us 
there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and
one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>Howbeit there is not in every man that 
knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a
thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>But meat commendeth us not 
to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are
we the worse.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>But take 
heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them 
that are weak.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10><H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>For if 
any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall 
not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which 
are offered to idols;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ 
died?</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>But when ye sin 
so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against 
Christ.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>Wherefore, if 
meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, 
lest I make my brother to offend.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><!--Public Domain Freeware -
