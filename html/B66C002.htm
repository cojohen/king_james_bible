the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth
the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden 
candlesticks;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V2><H4>2</H4></TD><TD><P>I know 
thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them 
which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are 
not, and hast found them liars:</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V3><H4>3</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast 
laboured, and hast not fainted.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V4><H4>4</H4> 
</P></TD><TD><P>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy 
first love.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V5><H4>5</H4></TD><TD><P>Remember 
therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or 
else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his
place, except thou repent.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V6><H4>6</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I 
also hate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V7><H4>7</H4></TD><TD><P>He that hath 
an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that 
overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the 
paradise of God.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V8><H4>8</H4></TD><TD><P>And 
unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and
the last, which was dead, and is alive;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V9><H4>9</H4></TD><TD><P>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou 
art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are 
not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V10>
<H4>10</H4></TD><TD><P>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the 
devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall 
have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a 
crown of life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V11><H4>11</H4></TD><TD><P>He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that 
overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V12><H4>12</H4></TD><TD><P>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; 
These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</P></TD></TR><TR> 
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V13><H4>13</H4></TD><TD><P>I know thy works, and where thou 
dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast
not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, 
who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V14><H4>14</H4></TD><TD><P>But I have a few things against thee, because thou 
hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a 
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto 
idols, and to commit fornication.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V15> 
<H4>15</H4></TD><TD><P>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the 
Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V16> 
<H4>16</H4></TD><TD><P>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight 
against them with the sword of my mouth.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V17><H4>17</H4></TD><TD><P>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith 
unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden 
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> 
<A NAME=V18><H4>18</H4></TD><TD><P>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira

of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A 
NAME=V19><H4>19</H4></TD><TD><P>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, 
and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</P></TD> 
</TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V20><H4>20</H4></TD><TD><P>Notwithstanding I have a 
few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which 
calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD 
VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V21><H4>21</H4></TD><TD><P>And I gave her space to repent of her 
fornication; and she repented not.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V22> 
<H4>22</H4></TD><TD><P>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit 
adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their 
deeds.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V23><H4>23</H4></TD><TD><P>And I will 
kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he
which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you 
according to your works.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V24><H4>24</H4></TD> 
<TD><P>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this 
doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will 
put upon you none other burden.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V25> 
<H4>25</H4></TD><TD><P>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</TD></TR> 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A NAME=V26><H4>26</H4></TD><TD><P>And he that overcometh, and 
keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</P></TD>

with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:</A> 
even as I received of my Father.
